“Sudoku Solver”
A code in C , can be used for solving 4x4, 9x9 and 16x16 sudoku puzzles.

Description

Data can be entered manually by the user, but data can also be read from a file. Solving this riddle is done by means of a backtracking algorithm. This program includes a user-friendly interface with clear user instructions. This code tells the user whether the data entered is wrong or not, and if so, the puzzle is solvable. The solver uses a recursive approach to find the solution taking into account the constraints of the Sudoku puzzle, such as row, column and block uniqueness. Solving the puzzle is effectively done.

Getting Started

Dependencies

Some of the dependencies of this code are:
- [ ] libraries:<stdio.h>,<stdlib.h>,<string.h>,<math.h>,"struct.h"(a custom header file specific to the code implementation. It contains the definition of a structure and a function used in the Sudoku solver algorithm.)
- [ ] This code is written in the standard C language, so any operating system that supports the C language is acceptable to run this code. Windows: Microsoft Visual C++, MinGW, Cygwin macOS: Xcode (includes Clang)
          Linux: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang

Installing

To download this code, simply copy and paste it into a file with the extension .c

Attention! If you want the data to be read from a file, be careful about the file format and name, also the file must be in the same directory as the executable file or you can specify the exact file path.


Executing program

- [ ] Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code) on your computer.
- [ ] Copy the code from the previous response and paste it into the text editor.
- [ ] Save the file with a ".c" extension, such as "puzzleSolver.c".
- [ ] Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
- [ ] Navigate to the directory where you saved the "puzzleSolver.c" file using the cd command.
- [ ] Compile the code using a C compiler. For example, with GCC, you can run the command: gcc -o sudokuSolver sudokuSolver.c.
- [ ] After successful compilation, an executable file will be created. You can run the program by executing the command: ./sudokuSolver (Linux or macOS) or sudokuSolver.exe (Windows).
